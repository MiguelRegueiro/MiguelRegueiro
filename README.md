### 👋 About Me
I am a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student in Spain focused on building practical software and improving it through iteration.
I build end-to-end features, with a primary focus on backend and systems reliability.

- **How I work:** I learn by shipping real projects, then refining performance, structure, and usability.
- **Platform experience:** Daily use of CachyOS and Fedora, with hands-on testing across Linux environments.
- **Current focus:** Building practical tools that solve real workflow problems.

### ⚡ Featured Work

- [**ssh-watchdog**](https://github.com/MiguelRegueiro/ssh-watchdog): GNOME Shell extension for real-time SSH session monitoring, published on GNOME Extensions for install via Extension Manager.
- [**MyCachyOSDotFiles**](https://github.com/MiguelRegueiro/MyCachyOSDotFiles): I believe a developer is only as good as their environment, so I built a CachyOS/GNOME setup focused on speed, transparency, and automation.
